        <!-- Absolute links
        Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: scheme://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination.

        Relative links
        Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.

        Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on. -->
